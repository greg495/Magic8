All that glitters is not gold
Hell is empty and all the devils are here.
Something wicked this way comes.
The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
These violent delights have violent ends...
Brevity is the soul of wit.
Now is the winter of our discontent.
If music be the food of love, play on.
Good night, good night!
Fair is foul, and foul is fair.
